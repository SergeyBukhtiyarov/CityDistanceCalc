# CityDistanceCal 
#This application  is able to calculate the distance between cities in two ways:
                              - “Crowflight” (straight distance) between cities 
                              - “Distance matrix” (distance table in the database).
#This application make it possible to uploads XML file with cities into the application.It parses and stores it into the database. (You should send POST request in POSTMAN)
